# Laravel Hydra

## Requirements

Laravel ^7.0.0

## Installation

This package is not yet on packagist.org so needs a local installation. For instance besides the project you want to use this in.

`git clone https://github.com/rb1193/laravel-hydra.git`

Add this path to repositories to your project `composer.json`.

```
"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../laravel-hydra"
          }
      ]
```

Now step back in your project and add the package.

`composer require arbee/laravel-hydra`
